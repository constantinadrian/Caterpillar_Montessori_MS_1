- #### Surface

    -  ##### Colour Scheme

        - Palette:

            ![Palette Colors](readme/palette-colors.jpg) 

            - The primary color that I choice is lemon-meringue because it inspires: Positivity, Purity and is the symbol of Happiness and Optimism.

            - The secondary color I used is prussian-blue because it is often associated with Stability and it symbolizes Trust, Loyalty and Confidence.

            - The final color I choose is white to be neutral backdrop to the text and other elements that I used on the page (images) and because White represents Purity and Innocence.

            - A Color Gradient was used as well from all colors to design a section of Home page.

    -  ##### Typography

        - The font-families chosen are Playfair Display and Courgette. For the consistency I used Courgette for Logo, Headings and Titles and for the Navigation Bar, Footer and Paragraphs I used Playfair Display.

    -  ##### Imagery

  - #### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

    I. First Time Visitor Goals

      - As a first-time visitor I want to understand the main purpose of the site and find out about the services offered.

        1. As the users enters the site, they are automatically greeted with a clean and easy-to-read navigation bar to access the page of their choice. Below is a Hero Image with Welcome text and a "Enroll Your Child" Call to action button.

        2. The main points are made immediately with the Hero Image and the text.

        3. The users has two options, click the call to action button or to scroll down to learn more about the organisation.

      - As a first-time visitor I want to be able to easily navigate through the site.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user thus I have made the navigation bar fixed so the user can easily used when needed

        2. At the bottom of each page there are link that could easily redirect the users to diffent pages.

      - As a first-time visitor I want to find testimonials from established clients.

        1. As the users scroll down the home page immediately after the why choose us section they will find What Parrents Say section where they can read the testemonials 

    II.	Returning User Goals:

      - As a returning visitor, I want to be able to get in contact so I can get more information about a particular subject.

        1. As the users returning there are several ways to get in contact with the business owner:

            1. On the 3rd Carousel Hero-Image on the Home page there is a Contact Us - Call to action button. 

            2. On the navigation bar of each page there is a link to Contact Us page.

            3. On the footer of each page their is a link to Contact Us page.

      - As a returning visitor, I want to find links to the social media of the business.

        1. The Users can easily find the links to social media on the footer of each page and on the contact page section.

  - #### Testing on Different Browsers

    - The following web browsers were used for testing the browser compatibility and responsive (System:Windows 10 64-bit).

        1. Chrome - Version 87.0

        2. Firefox - Version 84.0.2

        3. Edge - Version 87.0

        4. Opera - Version:73.0

        5. IE - Version 20H2

        All test was good. 

  - #### Testing on Different Devices

    1. Iphone 11 - IOS 14.0.1

    2. Ipad Mini 2 - IOS 12.4.8 

    3. Huawei P Smart

    4. Iphone 5S - IOS 10.2.1

    All test was good except the Iphone 5S (see Bugs)

  - A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linked correctly.

  - #### Known Bugs

    - On IE all hero image from carousel from index page were stretched.

        - The img tag was remove as object-fit property didn't have support in IE and was replace with div tag with a class attribute in order to set up background image. All images were display correctly after.

    - When added the 404.html Page - the page was not working after multiple attends 

        - On Slack community there was a pinned info about the 404 functionality. All I had to do was to create a 404.md file and place it with the 404.html in the root folder. Even so the 404 Page was working when the redirect was from index.html page as the other pages was move into a folder call "pages". After move all the pages back to root folder the 404 Page was working correctly when the mistype was on any of the pages.

            The 404.md file content:
            ```
            ---
            permalink: /404.html
            ---
            ```
    - On Iphone 5S (IOS 10.2.1) the hover efect on the cards on "Why Choose Us" section does not work and the user can't see the text that it's hidden when interact on the card. 

        - After multiple search I found that the hover effect does not work across all mobile devices, only the latest, as this efect was only for desktops.
